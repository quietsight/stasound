							Through a simple checkout process, Verified by Visa confirms your identity when you make purchases at participating online stores. It's convenient, and it works with your existing Visa card.</p>
							<p>Plus, Verified by Visa is a snap to use. You register your card just once, and create your own password. Then, when you make purchases at participating online stores, a Verified by Visa window will appear. Simply enter your password and click submit. Your identity is verified and the purchase is secure.</p>
							<p>To activate Verified by Visa in your Visa card, or to learn more, contact the financial institution that issued your Visa card or visit <A href="http://www.visa.com/verified" target=_blank>www.visa.com</A>.</p>
