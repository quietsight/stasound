                Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, Licensor owns and retains all rights, title, and interest in the Software, Documentation, and any and all related materials. This Agreement does not transfer ownership rights in the Software, Documentation, or any related materials to Licensee or any third party. Licensee shall reproduce, install, and render the Software operational only on one E-Commerce Web Site. Licensee has no right to sublicense, create derivative works based on the Software, or to permit anyone else to do so. Licensee shall not distribute the Software to any persons or entities other than Licensee's employees, consultants, or contractors for use on any other E-Commerce Web Site.  If Licensee allows any third party to use or have access to the Software, the third party shall be considered a Licensee by the terms of this Agreement and shall be liable for any unauthorized use of the Software under the terms of this Agreement. Licensee may not sell the Software to any person or make any other commercial use of the Software. Licensee shall retain all copyright and trademark notices on the Software and Documentation and shall take other necessary steps to protect Licensor's intellectual property rights.

                <em>1.2 Modifications to the Software</em>
                <br>
                Licensor acknowledges that Licensee may need to make modifications to the Software’s source code, provided such modifications do not violate any other parts of this Agreement, including the Proprietary Notices specified under section 1.4. However, Licensee may not distribute, trade, or sell any of the files received from Licensor in whole or part, even if Licensee has modified their source code. Even if Licensee or their agents make modifications to the source code, Licensee is still bound by the terms of this Agreement. If Licensee makes any modifications to the source code, NetSource Commerce shall not provide technical support on the Software as expressed in section 2.1. Licensee also acknowledges that such modifications may be overwritten if Licensee installs upgraded versions of the source code if and when they are released.
                <br><br>
                <em>1.3 Ownership</em>
                <br>
                The Software and all modifications or enhancements to, or derivative works based on the Software, whether created by NetSource Commerce, Licensee or another third party, and all copyrights, patents, trade secrets, trademarks and other intellectual property rights protecting or pertaining to any aspect of the Software or any such modification, enhancement or derivative work shall not alter this Agreement and the Software shall remain the sole and exclusive property of NetSource Commerce and, where applicable, NetSource Commerce's suppliers. This Agreement does not convey title or ownership to Licensee or another third party, but instead gives Licensee only the limited rights set forth in this Agreement.
                <br><br>
                <em>1.4 Proprietary Notices</em>
                <br>

                <em>1.5 Administration Console</em>
                <br>
                Each copy of the Software includes a back-end administration console ("Console" or "Control Panel") that allows Licensee to partially control the appearance and functionality of the electronic commerce store created by the Software, which Licensee may use in accordance with this Agreement and specifically with the terms in section 1.4.

                <br>
                The Software includes source code that allows Licensee to integrate their authorized domain store with UPS' Online Tools, which is a set of shipping and tracking services provided by UPS for Internet merchants. In compliance with UPS' Online Tools usage policy, Licensee agrees not to modify the source code of the following files (collectively the "UPS Files"): (a) PCADMIN folder: pcUPSConfirmLabel.asp, UPS_AVPopup.asp, UPS_EditSettings.asp, UPS_EditShipOptions.asp, UPS_ManageShipmentsCancel.asp, UPS_ManageShipmentsRequest.asp, UPS_ManageShipmentsResults.asp, UPS_ManageShipmentsTrack.asp, UPS_Preferences.asp; (b) PC folder: UPSShipRates.asp. In some versions of the Software, the source code of the UPS Files has also been encrypted. Regardless of whether the source code of the UPS Files has been encrypted or not, any modifications to the software source code in the UPS Files violates the UPS Access User Agreement that Licensee will enter into before use of the UPS Online Tools, and may result in the termination of the UPS Access User Agreement and of Licensee’s right to use the UPS Online Tools. Licensee is advised to contact their UPS Account Representative before making any such modifications, if modifications to the integration of the Software with UPS's Online Tools are needed.

                <br>
                As a FedEx Compatible Solution, the Software includes source code that allows Licensee to have access to and use FedEx Systems to retrieve shipping rates, obtain tracking information, and finalize shipments (collectively "FedEx Services"). This source code should not be modified to ensure the accuracy of the FedEx Services provided by the Software. To this extent, Licensee agrees not to modify the source code of the following files (collectively the "FedEx Files"): (a) PCADMIN folder: ConfigureOption5.asp; (b) INCLUDES folder: pcFedExWSClass.asp; (c) PC folder: FedExWebServices.asp. In some versions of the Software, the source code of the FedEx Files has also been encrypted.

Licensee is advised to contact their FedEx Account Representative before making any such modifications, if modifications to the integration of the Software with the FedEx Services are needed.

                <em>1.8 Computation of Sale Taxes and display of Value Added Tax</em>
                <br>
                This Software contains a tax module to help Licensee calculate and add sales taxes to orders or display Value Added Tax included in orders. The tax calculation features provided by the Software may or may not allow Licensee to calculate and collect sales or other taxes in compliance with Licensee’s local tax laws. It is Licensee’s duty to consult any local tax Authority to determine the tax laws to which the Licensee needs to adhere. NetSource Commerce shall not be liable under any circumstance for any tax miscalculations performed by the Software or for sales or other taxes that Licensee did not pay to their local Tax Authority.
                <br><br>
                <em>1.9 Collection of Payments</em>
                <br>
                This Software contains modules that allow Licensee to collect payment on orders received through the Software by use of a payment system provided and managed by a third party. Examples of such systems are: Google Checkout, all payment systems offered by PayPal, and all payment gateways that allow Internet merchants to process a payment via a Web site. Such payment systems authorize and debit the credit card, debit card, electronic check or other payment method used to pay for an order received through the Software. Licensee is fully responsible for confirming that the funds are successfully collected. Specifically, in the event in which the payment system chosen by the Licensee allows for the authorization of the collected funds without automatic settlement of the authorized transactions, Licensee is fully responsible for ensuring that those transactions are settled before they expire. Licensor is not liable for any loss of income in any way related to the collection of funds from a payment system used in conjunction with the Software.
                <br><br>
                <em>1.10 Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA-DSS) Program Terms and Conditions</em>
                <br>
                Acceptance of a given payment application by the PCI Security Standards Council, LLC (PCI SSC) only applies to the specific version of that payment application that was reviewed by a PA-QSA and subsequently accepted by PCI SSC (the "Accepted Version"). If any aspect of a payment application or version thereof is different from that which was reviewed by the PA-QSA and accepted by PCI SSC – even if the different payment application or version (the "Alternate Version") conforms to the basic product description of the Accepted Version – then the Alternate Version should not be considered accepted by PCI SSC, nor promoted as accepted by PCI SSC.
                <br><br>
                No vendor or other third party may refer to a payment application as "PCI Approved" or "PCI SSC Approved", and no vendor or other third party may otherwise state or imply that PCI SSC has, in whole or part, accepted or approved any aspect of a vendor or its services or payment applications, except to the extent and subject to the terms and restrictions expressly set forth in a written agreement with PCI SSC, or in a PA-DSS letter of acceptance provided by PCI SSC. All other references to PCI SSC’s approval or acceptance of a payment application or version thereof are strictly and actively prohibited by PCI SSC.
                <br><br>
                When granted, PCI SSC acceptance is provided to ensure certain security and operational characteristics important to the achievement of PCI SSC's goals, but such acceptance does not under any circumstances include or imply any endorsement or warranty regarding the payment application vendor or the functionality, quality, or performance of the payment application or any other product or service. PCI SSC does not warrant any products or services provided by third parties. PCI SSC acceptance does not, under any circumstances, include or imply any product warranties from PCI SSC, including, without limitation, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for purpose or noninfringement, all of which are expressly disclaimed by PCI SSC. All rights and remedies regarding products and services that have received acceptance from PCI SSC, shall be provided by the party providing such products or services, and not by PCI SSC or any payment brands.

                <br>
                If Licensee purchased the Software from NetSource Commerce, Licensee may request a refund only if Licensee submits a request for refund within 30 days of the date of purchase and complies with the terms of sections 3.2 and 4.3. The purchase amount, minus a restocking fee of 10% of the purchase amount, will be refunded upon receipt of the signed Certificate of Destruction agreement, which will be provided to Licensee. A return or refund does not release Licensee from liability for any unauthorized use of the Software or any failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement. If Licensee purchased the Software from a NetSource Commerce Reseller, Licensee must contact the Reseller directly to request a refund. NetSource Commerce will issue refunds only to Licensees that purchased the Software directly from NetSource Commerce. 
                <br><br>
                <em>4.3 Certificate of Destruction</em>

This certificate will be sent to Licensee within ten (10) days of the notification by Licensee of the request for refund. If the request for refund occurs after thirty (30) days from the date of purchase, no refund shall be given. Failure to return Certification of Destruction within a timely fashion shall not affect the rights of NetSource Commerce under the terms of this contract to seek remedies, including the right to institute an action for injunctive relief against licensee, and to collect for any damages which result from a continued use of the Software.
