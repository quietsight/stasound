Chips were so bad at one point that we couldn’t pick up her feet because her feet hurt so bad. We had actually thought about putting her down. Needless to say, we spent thousands on injections and corrective shoeing. I was introduced to Sta-Sound about 2 months ago. I have not seen my mare walk without bobbing her head for almost two years. I cannot tell you the last time I saw her running and kicking up her heels in the pasture. In the last month we have watched this wonderful mare do all these things! And without her heel shoes on even!! I rode her for the first time in two years last night and it was like I had never missed riding her a day. I was apprehensive this morning thinking she might be lame....NOT AT ALL! She ran out of the back of the barn straight to the pasture and never skipped a beat. Wouldn’t it be great if she went back into the show pen!! We are Sta-Sound addicted for sure!&#8221;

		<p class="productdesc">&#8220;I absolutely love the animal products and swear allegiance to their healing powers for both my dog and my horses! I have a gelding that was injured about 5 years ago and it was affecting his ability to be used. As the years went by, he was lame quite often from just moving himself around. We could ride him very little. We tried several joint products, one of them was a well advertized product called Cetyl~M @ 100.00 a month. He did not like the taste of it and would sort it out of his grain and I was throwing alot of it away. And it stank!!! Nasty smelling stuff! However, it did ease his discomfort and we could ride him again~but the cost was enormous and the waste was discouraging, so I was looking for something just as effective that would be cheaper. I had tried so many products already I was frustrated at what to do. We met some folks at church that suggested Sta Natural equine joint supplement. So I got a 1-month supply and began immediately. The very first thing I noticed was that it didn’t stink at all and he licked the bottom of his grain bucket to get every granule! I could feed him way less grain which assisted me in his weight management and within the first week he began running and playing with the young geldings in the pasture each day. He was even rearing and sparring in joy! We hadn’t seen him do any of that in years. So we agreed that this was a much better product than Cetyl~M or any other product we had tried and at 1/2 the cost per month. My gelding is now giving 2-3 lessons to students each day~ comfortably ~ and without obvious signs of lameness. I will never switch away from this product. It will be in my barn as long as I own horses! I even use it when youngsters reach a point in their training that I have to push them hard~and never do they have hot stifles and hocks as did training colts in the past. Thank you Sta~Natural for developing such a tremendous product!&#8221;

		<p class="productdesc">&#8220;A friend of mine told me about Sta-Sound Fly-B-Gone all natural fly spray. He said it was a great fly spray, safe for the kids and animals, and the price was right. So I decided to give it a test, and this is how I tested it. I went to the Atwoods farm and ranch store in Woodward, Oklahoma and bought a bottle of Bronco Fly Spray, and then I bought a bottle of Sta-Sound Fly-B-Gone.</p><br>

		<p class="productdesc">Side by side, I used the sprays for two weeks on my horses. It did not take me long to figure out which fly spray was the best and which one lasted almost eight times longer than the other spray. Sta-Sound Fly-B-Gone is the fly spray I will be using from now on.&#8221;

		<p class="productdesc">&#8220;Sta-Sound and Fix-A-Stride have been great assets to our program with the show cattle and Kyra’s barrel horses. Juli has fed Sta-Sound to the horses for five years. I’ve seen a noticeable difference in stride flexibility, softer pasterns and vigor on the cattle. This year we had a steer that got strong on his pasterns about every third step. We saw a difference in movement after about three weeks while taking Fix-A-Stride. We are using this product as a preventive and to address any soundness issues. This is important to us in the competitive show ring and in transporting livestock to and from shows. This is the best joint supplement on the market and the most reasonably priced.&#8221;

After being on Fix-A-Stride, we noticed it was keeping him comfortable, giving him stamina and keeping him flexible. That steer went on to be Reserve Grand Champion Overall at Fort Worth. We have put all the cattle on Fix-A-Stride as part of our management protocol. It is a great product for slick sheer shows!&#8221;
